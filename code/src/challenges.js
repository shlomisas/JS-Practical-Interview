function duplicate (arr) {

    /**
     * Write a function which duplicates array.
     * For instance:
     *      when you call `duplicate([1,2,3]);`
     *      it should returns `[1,2,3,1,2,3]`
     *
     *  Questions:
     *      1. Write it without mutating original array.
     *      2. Rewrite it in "modern" way
     *      3. Add ability to use it on array instance like `[1,2,3].duplicate();`
     *      4. Re-use function `duplicate` from 1st question to fit 3rd question.
