* Each search result contain the following fields: video thumbnail, name and a play button
* When click play button, the YouTube player underneath start play the video. also, a new `history` record will save into our database and will add to the history list on the left.
* When click on a video form the history list, it'll play in the player. 
* When user click `delete` on each history record, it'll delete from the database and will remove form the history list.

* For a database, please use Mongo or MySql.
* For YouTube operations use the following:  
    * For the search use [this Search API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search) 
    * For the player use [this iFrame SDK](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference)
* Please try express yourself as much you can, try to use your daily basis coding so we can see your level and knowledge

## Task output
